# Water-Quality-Prediction-using-machine-learning
This study explores machine learning (ML) techniques for accurate water quality prediction. Traditional water
quality assessment methods are often time-consuming and costly.
Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of physical, chemical, and
biological parameters, various ML models are trained and
evaluated to forecast key water quality indicators like pH,
Trihalomethanes,Sulfate and Chloramines.
Employing feature engineering and model optimization, algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support
Vector Machines, and Neural Networks are tested. Performance
evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall determine the
best-performing model. Successful ML-based prediction enables
real-time monitoring, aiding in timely interventions for maintaining water safety and environmental health. This research
demonstrates the efficacy of ML in accurate water quality prediction, facilitating informed decision-making for water resource
management.
